        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome again to my blog! This week, I focused on improving the results of corner detections, so that we can use the results to measure the dimensions of the detected object. </p><h2 id="Try-the-demo"><a href="#Try-the-demo" class="headerlink" title="Try the demo!"></a>Try the demo!</h2><p>As always, I prepared a demo so that you can intuitively understand what was I doing this week.

I think what causes Hough Line Transform to perform poorly is that the lines aren’t exactly straight, and they are kind of “wiggly” (see image below). </p><p><img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week4.assets/image-20210513164901397.png" alt="lines being wiggly"></p><center> The line in the image is not exactly straight </center><p>I tried reducing the angle step size (theta of HLT), increasing the minimum length of line detected, and then decreasing the threshold of HLT. This gave me a small improvement, but the lines detected are still fragmented and far from usable. </p><p><img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week4.assets/image-20210513171233499.png" alt="Hough line transform tweaking"></p><center> Hough Line Transform result comparison </center><h2 id="Tweaking-Corner-Detection-Algorithms"><a href="#Tweaking-Corner-Detection-Algorithms" class="headerlink" title="Tweaking Corner Detection Algorithms"></a>Tweaking Corner Detection Algorithms</h2><p>Based on the results, it looks like Hough Line Transform, although being widely used, does not fit my demand very well. It could also be that my tweaking is not right. Anyways, I decided to try tweaking the corner detection algorithms as introduced in last week’s blog post. </p><p>I tried using the two commonly used corner detection algorithms, Harris and Shi-Tomasi, last week. However, they did not produce impressive results either. The points detected tend to cluster on the top left corners of the shapes, and many corners get detected multiple times. </p><p>I had no clue how to fix this problem at first, since I don’t see anything that I did wrong compared to tutorials and essays I found online. Then I realized one significant difference between my use case and that of the tutorials - the tutorials mostly use only one shape when detecting corners, while I tried to detect the corners of multiple shapes. </p><p>So, I decided to add a function to the program that allows users to crop the images to a single shape, and also added an option to limit the points to be detected by the Shi-Tomasi corner detection function. They turn out to work great together, and the final product is finally usable now! (Hooray!)</p><p><img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week4.assets/image-20210518150435858.png" alt="Image cropping function"></p><center> Image cropping function </center><p><img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week4.assets/image-20210518150744957.png" alt="Shi-Tomasi detection result"></p><center> Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection Result </center><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>This week, I made improvements to the corner detection function to make produce better results.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my week 3 blog post! This week, I focused on finding ways to get the corners found in the images by tweaking the parameters for Hough Line Transform, as well as trying different methods. </p><h2 id="Get-hands-on-with-my-program"><a href="#Get-hands-on-with-my-program" class="headerlink" title="Get hands on with my program!"></a>Get hands on with my program!</h2><p>Just as last week, I deployed the program I wrote as a web app. You may find it here: <a href="https://senior-project.jessexu.me/?file_selection=Week+3">https://senior-project.jessexu.me/?file_selection=Week+3</a> </p><p>You can now select a different sample image to experiment with in the variable control panel (but I will use the default one throughout this blog post). You can also tweak the parameters for Hough Line Transform there. </p><h2 id="Solving-problem-in-contour-extraction"><a href="#Solving-problem-in-contour-extraction" class="headerlink" title="Solving problem in contour extraction"></a>Solving problem in contour extraction</h2><p>Last week, I had a first glance at Hough Line Transform. However, the results I got from it were not impressive. The detected lines were short and piled up, which are no what we wanted. We want to get long and clean lines from the contours, so that we can calculate the corners of the shapes by taking the intersection of the lines. </p><p><img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week3.assets/image-20210428093424150.png" alt="Previous Hough Line Transform Results"></p><center> Previous Hough Line Transform Results </center><p>I soon found the issue in my code that caused a line to be detected multiple times. I was using <code>cv2.findContours()</code> then <code>cv2.drawContours()</code> to find and draw the contours. However, I drew the contours with a line thickness of 3 to make it look more obvious, which makes Hough Line Transform think that there are multiple short lines there. After changing the line thickness to 1, many repeated lines were eliminated.</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># cv2.drawContours() usage:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># drawContours: (image, contours, contourIdx, color, thickness=..., ...) </span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># My previous code: </span></span><br><span class="line">img = cv2.drawContours(blank, contours, -<span class="number">1</span>, (<span class="number">255</span>, <span class="number">255</span>, <span class="number">255</span>), <span class="number">3</span>)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Improved code:</span></span><br><span class="line">img = cv2.drawContours(blank, contours, -<span class="number">1</span>, (<span class="number">255</span>, <span class="number">255</span>, <span class="number">255</span>), <span class="number">1</span>) <span class="comment"># Changed thickness</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>However, when I was trying to solve this problem, I stumbled upon an algorithm called Canny edge detection. It is conveniently available in OpenCV as the method <code>cv2.Canny()</code>, it produces almost identical results with the combination of <code>cv2.findContours()</code> and <code>cv2.drawContours()</code> if not better. So, I decided to use Canny in the end. </p><p><img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week3.assets/image-20210428101905085.png" alt="Canny and findContours comparison"></p><center> Canny and findContours comparison </center><h2 id="Tweaking-Hough-Line-Transform"><a href="#Tweaking-Hough-Line-Transform" class="headerlink" title="Tweaking Hough Line Transform"></a>Tweaking Hough Line Transform</h2><p>After solving the problem in contour extraction, we got better results with Hough Line Transform. However, the results are still far from usable for corner detection. The following picture is about the best I got from tweaking the various parameters for the Hough Line Transform function. </p><p><img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week3.assets/image-20210428110205711.png" alt="Hough Line Transform after contour extraction"></p><center> Hough Line Transform after contour extraction </center><p>The lines are not piled up anymore, but there are still many short lines that did not merge with the longer lines. It’s a tricky situation: if I turn up the minimum line length parameter, then some line segments don’t get detected and leaving it blank; if I turn up the longest gap parameter, the short gaps in between the shapes gets connected and recognized as a line. </p><p>I’ve also looked up the meaning of the parameters and the mechanism behind Hough Line Transform, but I still cannot find the best parameters that could give satisfying results. I believe it’s due to the fact that the lines are not exactly straight and that they have rounded corners. </p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># My understanding of the parameters</span></span><br><span class="line">cv2.HoughLinesP(</span><br><span class="line">  image, <span class="comment"># Input image</span></span><br><span class="line">    rho, <span class="comment"># Step size for line searching (pixel)</span></span><br><span class="line">    theta, <span class="comment"># Angle step size for line searching (radians) (I set it to pi/360)</span></span><br><span class="line">    threshold, <span class="comment"># Threshold for accumulation of pixels to form a line</span></span><br><span class="line">    lines, <span class="comment"># Limit the number of lines to be detected</span></span><br><span class="line">    minLineLength, <span class="comment"># Minimum length of line, lines with length shorter than this will be discarded</span></span><br><span class="line">    maxLineGap, <span class="comment"># Maximum distance between lines to merge the two lines</span></span><br><span class="line">)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="Trying-other-corner-detection-algorithms"><a href="#Trying-other-corner-detection-algorithms" class="headerlink" title="Trying other corner detection algorithms"></a>Trying other corner detection algorithms</h2><p>Since I can’t get satisfying results from tweaking Hough Line Transform, I turn to find other corner detection algorithms.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone, welcome to my blog again. It has been a busy week for me, and I did some work to preprocess the images for recognition. </p><h2 id="See-my-work"><a href="#See-my-work" class="headerlink" title="See my work!"></a>See my work!</h2><p>In order to give you a clearer idea of what I did, I put some extra efforts to put my work as an web app using the free hosting service Heroku (huge thanks to them!), so that you can get your hands on and experiment with the program I wrote. You may find it here: <a href="https://senior-project.jessexu.me/?file_selection=Week+2">https://senior-project.jessexu.me/?file_selection=Week+2</a> (loading time may be a bit long because the images are being processed in real-time, and make sure you have good Internet)</p><h2 id="What-does-the-program-do"><a href="#What-does-the-program-do" class="headerlink" title="What does the program do?"></a>What does the program do?</h2><p>You may be a bit confused if you head straight into the web app above, so let me explain what is the program I wrote this week doing. </p><p>I will use the parameters that I set as the default of the app when I’m explaining. They turn out to produce pretty good results after I experimented with them. </p><p> <img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week2.assets/image-20210422173039847.png" alt="Default Parameters"></p><center>Default parameters<center/><p>Let’s start with the original image. It’s a photo of a part of the gyroscope. As mentioned in last week’s blog post, the preprocessing I need to apply on the photo is to denoise the image, find the contours of the part (in this photo’s case, the contours of the broaches/combs), and find the corners of the parts. </p><img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week2.assets/image-20210423093322870.png" alt="Original image" style="zoom:50%;" /><p>First, we need to turn it into a grayscale image for further processing. OpenCV has a handy method for this: </p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week2.assets/image-20210423114958615.png" alt="Grayscale image" style="zoom:50%;" /><p>Then, we can filter out some of the noise in the photo to get a clearer shot by first dilating then eroding the image. It can be done with the following two lines of code. With higher iterations, more noise will be filtered out, but it may also distort the image. </p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">kernel = np.ones((<span class="number">3</span>, <span class="number">3</span>), np.uint8) <span class="comment"># We use a commonly used 3x3 kernel for this.</span></span><br><span class="line">dilated_img = cv2.dilate(gray, kernel, iterations) <span class="comment"># gray is the grayscale image.</span></span><br><span class="line">eroded_img = cv2.erode(dilate_img, kernel, iterations)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week2.assets/image-20210423115652416.png" alt="Dilation and erosion" style="zoom:50%;" /><p>Then, we can apply a threshold to the image with the following code to get a binary image from the de-noised image. You can see that one of the dirty points that did not get removed from previous processes was retained in the threshold processed image. </p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">cv2.threshold(erosion, threshold_value, <span class="number">255</span>, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week2.assets/image-20210423120048713.png" alt="threshold" style="zoom:50%;" /><p>With the binary image we have, we can get the contour of the shapes with the code below and draw it out. As you can see, the contours are quite clear.</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(binary_image, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week2.assets/image-20210423141418895.png" alt="contours" style="zoom:50%;" /><p>Lastly, we run a Hough Line Transform to detect the lines in the contours image, so we can find the corners and dimensions of the shapes. The code used here is </p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">lines = cv2.HoughLinesP(img, <span class="number">1</span>, np.pi/<span class="number">180</span>, <span class="number">100</span>,minLineLength=<span class="number">100</span>, maxLineGap=<span class="number">10</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week2.assets/image-20210423142525498.png" alt="Hough Line Transform Result" style="zoom:50%;" /><p>However, the results I get here is not very impressive, as it detects way more lines than it should, and there are small line segments clustered together if you zoom in the image. So, I will focus on fine-tuning the parameters for the Hough Line Transform next week. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone, thanks for your interest in my project. As mentioned in the project abstract, my project will focus on creating a program that recognizes and calculates the dimensions of parts in a MEMS gyroscope that needs to be etched with a laser from photos taken by a microscope camera. The program will then be put together with the works of other colleagues on the site to achieve the goal of automating the gyroscope-fixing process.  </p><h2 id="What-tools-will-I-use"><a href="#What-tools-will-I-use" class="headerlink" title="What tools will I use?"></a>What tools will I use?</h2><img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week1.assets/image-20210413163329340.png" alt="image-20210413163329340" style="zoom: 33%;" /><p><strong>OpenCV</strong> is a powerful and widely used image processing library for computer vision. It has a lot of built-in functions that allow developers to easily apply different effects and calculations on images. Since this project is focused on creating a program that deals with photos of a gyroscope, OpenCV will be the core of this project. </p><p>As for the choice of programming language, I chose <strong>Python</strong> as it is succinct and easy-to-use, so that I can focus on developing the algorithm for processing the images instead of wasting time on dealing with programming issues. Also, Python has great support and integration for OpenCV through the <code>opencv-python</code> library, it can be installed easily on any computer that has a python environment with a single line of command: <code>python -m pip install opencv-python</code>.</p><p>For creating an intuitive GUI (graphical user interface) program, I went with <strong>Streamlit</strong>, an awesome library in Python that offers a simple way to create web apps. It has plenty of built-in widgets such as sliders, buttons, and select-boxes that will come in handy when I need to tweak the parameters of image-processing functions.</p><h2 id="What-do-the-images-look-like"><a href="#What-do-the-images-look-like" class="headerlink" title="What do the images look like?"></a>What do the images look like?</h2><p>So what do the parts in a MEMS gyroscope look like, you may ask. Well, here’s a sneak peek at some sample images of it taken by a microscope camera. As you can see from the image below, parts in a gyroscope can be roughly categorized into three categories: triangles, rectangles, and broaches/combs. Recognizing these shapes and their dimensions will be one of the major goals of this project.</p><p>It may sound easy, but it is in fact quite hard to write a program with the aforesaid functionality. From my prior research, the rough process will be: denoising the images; finding the contours of the parts; finding the corners of the shapes; calibrating the image-to-reality scale; and computing the real sizes of the parts according to the scale. </p><p><img src="/img/bigz-senior-project-week1.assets/image-20210413162931134.png" alt="Images of a MEMS gyroscope"></p><p>That’s all for this week. Next week, I will start to apply some preprocessing to the images and try to find the contours of the gyroscope parts in the images. Stay tuned! </p>]]></content>

      <title>Jesse Jiaxi Xu&#39;s senior project - &quot;Make Computers See - Image Processing with OpenCV&quot;</title>
      <link href="/basis-senior-project/en/abstract/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Abstract-for-the-project"><a href="#Abstract-for-the-project" class="headerlink" title="Abstract for the project"></a>Abstract for the project</h3><p>MEMS gyroscopes are a type of sensor that is widely used in phones, cars, and many other devices to detect the rate of rotation. However, the mass production units of the gyroscope may be imprecise due to errors in production. One may need to fine-tune the gyroscopes to achieve higher precision. It can be accomplished by precisely etching parts of it with a laser. To automate the process, photos of the gyroscope will be taken with a microscope camera; a computer program will then recognize parts to be fixed and calculate the actual area to be fixed from the image taken; another program will use the results of the previous program and control the laser etching machine to etch the gyroscope. This project will focus on creating the computer program that recognizes and calculates the parts in the gyroscope to be fixed, and it will integrate with other colleagues’ programs to achieve the overarching goal. OpenCV is an image processing library that will be used in this project to process the image, and the processing algorithm will be implemented with the Python programming language. The major process of the project is to find the contours of parts in the gyroscope; identify certain shapes that make up the gyroscope; calculate the parts to be etched according to the image scale. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>最近在学校的 NHS* 里做一个有趣的项目——为学校的“赌场之夜”做两个老虎机，编写过程中遇到了些困难，最终学习了 Java 的多线程相关的知识然后解决了问题。</p><span id="more"></span><p>故事：我们学校的 NHS 开展了一个 Project，就是要以“赌场”为主题，举办一个 Winter Formal (“冬季舞会”)。我负责做两台老虎机。本来想偷懒，直接上网上找开源的 HTML5 的实现，但我的计算机老师鼓励我自己用 Java 实现，不要用现成的。我都想好怎么编了，编出来之后竟然不 work，本来应该是动画的地方只出现了转圈圈，程序冻住几秒，并没有按照预期播放动画。经过思考之后，学习了多线程的知识，然后解决了问题。就此记录该过程。</p><hr><p>一开始遇到的问题是这样的：写好了动画的代码，用 Thread.sleep(time) 来实现动画，但是运行的时候却只有鼠标转圈圈，没有动画，但是等几秒后（“动画”完成后），摇奖的结果会显示。估计是运行的时候 Thread 还没有更新 GUI 里面的的内容就 Sleep 了，或者是不是应该叫做被“阻塞”了？此时程序的情况如下图：</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgrddsj/PicLib/master/One%20Thread.gif"></p><p>于是我就上 YouTube 上面找 Java 多线程相关的教程，找到如下这个<a href="https://youtu.be/VYN-CBtPNiM">视频</a>（26和27集连起来看）。同时发现这个<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston">频道</a>有挺多编程相关的教程的，Java、Python……什么都有。推荐一下。（需要梯子）</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VYN-CBtPNiM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>其实就是在原来 GUI 的 class 之外再加一个 class（把原来的 Spin 相关的内容迁移到新的 class 里面，然后在 GUI class 里面提供 accessor method 以供修改显示的图片）。第二个 class 要在 class name 后面加上 implements Runnable ，同时把要运行的那段代码放在一个叫 run 的 method 里面（ IDE 会自动提示加上 import java.awt.EventQueue; ）。然后在 GUI class 里面加上下面的代码就行了（我的第二个 class 的名字叫做 “spin”）。<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Thread t1 = <span class="keyword">new</span> Thread(<span class="keyword">new</span> Spin(board,slot1Res,slot2Res,slot3Res));</span><br><span class="line">t1.start();</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>改好之后程序的程序的架构大概是这样的：</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgrddsj/PicLib/master/Two%20Threads.gif"></p><p>[^NHS]: National Honors Society</p>]]></content>
